        "\n",
        "[PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/) is a powerful Python library for **Bayesian statistical modeling** and **probabilistic machine learning**. It provides an intuitive and flexible way to define complex models using a **probabilistic programming framework**.\n",
        "\n",
        "PyMC makes it easy to express statistical models in terms of probability distributions, and it automates the process of computing posterior distributions using state-of-the-art Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods like:\n",
        "- [**No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS)**](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/hoffman14a/hoffman14a.pdf), an efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method.\n",
        "- **Metropolis-Hastings** ‚ a traditional and widely-used MCMC approach.\n",
        "\n",

        "$$\n",
        "P(\\theta | X) \\propto P(X | \\theta)P(\\theta)\n",
        "$$\n",
        "where:\n",
        "- $P(\\theta)$‚ a prior distribution (our prior belief about the parameters).\n",

        "\n",
        "Computing this posterior distribution analytically can be difficult or even impossible for complex models. PyMC solves this problem by using efficient numerical sampling techniques, allowing you to approximate the posterior distribution and extract meaningful insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How Does PyMC Work?\n",
        "1. **Model Definition**: Define the model using PyMC probabilistic building blocks (e.g., `pm.Normal`, `pm.Bernoulli`).\n",
        "2. **Sampling**: Use `pm.sample()` to draw samples from the posterior distribution.\n",
        "3. **Posterior Analysis**: Analyze the posterior samples to estimate parameters, uncertainties, and credible intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "PyMC builds on [**Theano**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theano_(software)), which allows it to compute gradients and perform symbolic differentiation for more efficient sampling."
